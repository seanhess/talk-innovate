Introduction
------------

Companies want to be innovative, but it's up to everyone to make it happen.

- training / learning
- exploring / trying new things
- refactoring
- paying down technical debt
- coming up with new ideas
- creativity
- exploring

What do these have in common?
-----------------------------

- they provide long-term benefits with short-term costs
- indirectly related to your goals

A different kind of work. It takes more time. Exploration. Curiosity. Where does it lead? 

Let's call this "Exploration"

Why do humans explore?

Why exploration in a tech company?
--------------------------------

What's the opposite of innovation, learning, exploring ?

Technical Debt

Why is technical debt bad?
--------------------------

Eventually your product owns you, your time, and your creative output. Loss of freedom to create.

Finances: Debt <==> Savings
-------------------

Debt results in a loss of freedom.

Savings result in a gain of freedom.

Debt ------- 0 ------- Savings

Paying off debts = Investing in the future

Financial Independence
----------------------

"I wish I could do that..." Invest!

Technical Debt
--------------

What is the equivalent of debt in a tech company?

- That feature is going to take 2 months, because we have to rejigger the whatzits.
- Every time I change anything, something else breaks!
- This code base is too big and old to change

Technical Investment
--------------------

****** 

What is the equivalent of investment?

- New technology
- New approaches

You can't afford not to explore
-------------------------------

- It's like transportation investment. Building an international airport or a train system. The Environment.
- be more autonomous?
- your progress WILL slow down dramatically over time
- brain drain: lose smart, curious people.
- Keep moving forward. Keep things fixed / done.

My Stories
----------

  - my first job: wasn't enough work, so I started playing around. Learned some PERL. Sweet. I made a tool ... what did I even make? I don't remember. Something. I was supposed to create online courses. I made something that did my work for me. Then I got hired to do that all the time. I made a tool that created multiple course formats from one source document. Obvious in hindsight, but they employed tons of people. Cut huge amounts of work out.

  - another story: I am a consultant. Between contracts, I build things. I explore. A few years ago I started learning Haskell. It's thought of as this obscure niche language (it's not), but it taught me things I had never thought of. Geeked out about type systems. Learned Typescript. Used Typescript very early on an angular project. Worked with a team of 3 people. Delivered a whole product and team in <9 months. Several large pivots in the middle. Able to make changes quickly. All possible because I was curious about something years earlier.

- Devops. So lame. Spend time learning and get ops off your plate.?

Awesome right? Let's make a startup!
------------------------------------
It's always the same story.
- Hack weeks
- Choose your technology
It's a good "idea"
Sacrificed! "Well, maybe after we ship X."

This always happens
-------------------

- I.TV - trying to do developer week and failing. We always put it off. Sacrificed it, because we had something to ship.
- they always think of hack weeks. "An actual product came out of it"
- We advertised it when we recruited "We're hip! We have dev week!"
- let's do dev day instead.
- it never happend
- we never shipped
- we were sad, depressed, ground down, death march.

Not How: Asking for permission
------------------------
- Bug your boss until he lets you have hack week.
Why not? Because he thinks of it as a soft benefit. As play. It IS fun, bu that's not the point. I guarnatee he'll sacrifice it later because "You can play when your chores are done."
Maybe he'll think "Oh a cool product might come out of hack week".

- Ask for permission to refactor. "We need to switch to ruby 2.0". "Can we do it later"? It builds up. Now you HAVE to ask for permission

This is a part of your craft
----------------------------

It's not your bosses job. It's yours. You need to deliver on time AND keep exploring.

Even if he understands it, he doesn't care about it like you do. It's YOUR craft. Own it.

How: Ship every week
--------------------

What does your boss want? He wants to deliver value to the customers.
It goes both ways: deliver something every week

- STORY: ????

How: Explore every week
----------------------

Fill the space with exploration. Ahead of schedule to ship this week? Try out that approach you read about!

Behind schedule? Ship something, but spend less time.

Investments pay off over time.

How: Coding best practices
--------------------------
Composition
Write stuff that does your work for you. Toolbox. Composition.
Functional. Small tools
Simple refactoring
Don't build an massive engine of desctruction. Build tools.

When: Start now!
----------------

There will always be a deadline. You will NEVER have more time.
